1) Should know how hash_tables work and how to use them
    - we will apply hash table to solve problems
    - leet code for practice

    - optimized solution will require use of hash hash_tables

2) focus on proof of work
  how the miner works
  how proof of work, works
  comforable with the miner code, and have pipenv set up, ready to code

3) Interview:

    short 5 min Interview w/ new TL
    answering three questions

    Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
    1) What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?
    2) What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?
    3) Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
    4) Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. 
        What kind of attack is possible?

    Judged based on fluency, may be follow up questions

    Be concise but cover everything within 5 minutes

    notes are okay, but don't read straight from paper
    
    quantified by "would you want to work with this person"
